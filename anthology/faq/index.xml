The canonical URL for papers is given by appending the ACL ID to the Anthology URL, e.g., https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E91-1001 Both the DOIs and the persistent URLs embed the 8-character ACL Anthology Identifier.
You can use variations on the canonical URL to access the paper page (by appending a /) or the BibTeX file (by appending .bib).</description></item><item><title>How does the ACL Anthology use Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)?</title><link>http://semdial.org/anthology/faq/doi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://semdial.org/anthology/faq/doi/</guid><description>The ACL uses DOIs to refer to scholarly works persistently in accordance with cross-disciplinary standards. Prior to 2012, ACL materials were assigned DOIs by the Association of Computational Machinery (ACM). Since 2014, ACL has assigned its own DOIs to materials using a convention based off of the ACL Anthology Identifiers. In 2015, ACL had to change DOI prefix due to accounting practices for the ACM.
